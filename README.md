## PureData connection workbench for FreeCAD

[FCPD](https://github.com/FlachyJoe/FCPD) is a set of [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD) python macros and [Pure-Data](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data) (aka PD) patches to link the two softwares. This workbench makes its use easier.

## What is it for ?

FreeCAD is more than a CAD and Pure-Data is more than *"a free real-time computer music system"*.
Using a real-time visual programming language to control FreeCAD can results in an orchestrated animation system or a procedural modeling one.
Or the reverse, imagine a real-time performance with visual/musical effects controlled by FreeCAD virtual objects.

As you can start to see, imagination and  programming skill are one's only limitation when using FCPD.
